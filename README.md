## About
After years I finally decided to create a personal website, but I wanted to do something more interesting and fun to code. My goal with this website goes far beyond having a personal website. Firstly, I wanted to get this idea I've had for years off paper, and secondly, I committed to myself this year to develop more things on my own and get all the projects I accumulate in my mind off paper.

### Concept 
I was inspired by the website created by the band Linkin Park to celebrate the 20th anniversary of their first album. 
The idea was to develop the site simulating an old operating system, appealing to nostalgia (which I personally am very fond of) and pixelart (which I think is really cool).

### Design
The design was created entirely by me, I would have liked to have created a prototype in Figma before starting development, but my mind changes a lot from one day to the next, so I wanted to have more creative freedom.

## Stack: 
* ReactJS 
* TypeScript
* CSS
* HTML
* JavaScript

### Why did I choose these tools?
It was clear from the beginning that my personal website should be built with ReactJS as this is my main and my first Stack, from my 5 years of experience as a front end developer, I can say that about 4 years were working day after day with the our beloved ReactJS.

### How I planned and executed development
When I decided to put the project into practice, I already partially knew how to execute some features. Although the site has a creative and different look, the development does not deviate much from the rule of a front-end application in React. State management to handle the opening of Modals was performed with useState and the execution of asynchronous functions with useEffect.


## What comes next?
The idea with my website is to transform it into a SuperApp that centralizes everything I build from now on. The first step will be to integrate a real blog (the current one is mocked in the code).
